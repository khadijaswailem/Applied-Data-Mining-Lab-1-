blob:this is the file json,python,txt etc and its meta data 
tree:directory 
commit:defines what the update is and says what it is and a pointer to the file , i press commit and type a message and request for my changes to be saved 

note: alg that hashes SHA 1 40 hexadecimals , when i update the file and it has a new hash different 
from the old file hash it gives a notification that a change has happened , a change even as small as clicking enter and saving

three tree architecture:
working tree/directory:
staging: if i want to go back and change smth before committing at the git repo 
git repo



inside empty folder:

echo "Hello ,Git" >> normally creating a file 

git init keda initializing repo to commit the changes to 


U= untracked and not in the repo

T can either be baa U el unmodified or M for modified 

Git status 

git add filename moves the file to the staging area 

git add . adds all the files 


NEVER ADD A SECRET KEY TO GITHUB

To remove git rm -- cached filename 

to move the file to the git repo

git commit -m "file1 added" this is just a message to do this must have already added it 


git config --global user.email mail



git commit -am " message" will go to the gitrepo aalatool , as if add and -m at the same time


get diff shows us eh el changes what files and what lines, shows diff between working tree and staging area
 a plus sign means smth we added and a - means smth we removed 

get diff --staged to get difference between staging and the repository  

the git log will show all the commits, the HEAD -> main is where the last commit is 

to create a new branch we create write git branch "name"

then to switch to that branch we write git switch "name"

then after we git merge to merge the new branch with the main

to go back to a previous commit write git reset --hard to apply directly everywhere 

can add after the hard HEAD~and then the number etc HEAD~1 goes back w1 step (goes back only)

git reflog numbers/index the commits so we can use them fel HEAD~number 

can also do HEAD@{12} thats where we will go back or move front and will see the change in the file directly

boiler plate is a template that we will be using for our assignments 

in logic.py we pt the functionalities we will use later on and will actally import it in the main.py

we put the things we need to download in the requirements.txt 

to activate the venv : .venv\Scripts\activate.bat 
to exit it :deactivate

pip install -r requirements.txt to install the things in the requirements file

pip list to make sure they got installed
